				<p class="lead page-header">Desktop GIS</p>
				<p>During my career I have primarily used Esri products, from ArcInfo Workstation to ArcView 3.x to the current release of ArcGIS Desktop.  Through my use of ArcGIS Desktop and design classes
				while at Penn State, I have built a strong background in cartographic design.  Having started in the command line environment of ArcInfo Workstation, which gives me an appreciation of how far desktop GIS has evolved over the years.  My first job out of college, at ECS, primarily focused on property mapping using ArcInfo Workstation, this gave me a strong foundation for GIS data entry.  From property mapping, my next career focus was GIS data collection for utility infrastructures at WK Dickson.</p>
				<p>In addition to Esri products, I have some experience with open source GIS products, including QGIS and GRASS.  The later was a software package that was the primary focus for the Geospatial Modeling and Analysis course at NC State University.  The image below is from the final project for this course which analyzed the affect of building shadows in downtown Raleigh.</p>
				<p class="lead page-header">Server GIS</p>
				<p>My first experience with server GIS began with using ArcIMS while at WK Dickson.  This then changed over to ArcGIS Server a few years later.  At WK Dickson we hosted project related data for client and internal use.  This was a simple way to show the client their project data while it was being collected in the field.  My use of ArcGIS Server increased exponentially when I started at the City of Raleigh.  My first task was to install ArcGIS Server and then create 30 to 40 map services using countywide data for consumption in the iMAPS property research application.
